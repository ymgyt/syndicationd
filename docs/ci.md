## GitHub Actions

### Workflows

| Workflow        | Trigger   | Role                         |
| ---             | ---       | ---                          |
| `audit`         | Schedule  | Audit security               |
| `ci`            | Push, PR  | Test, Lint, Coverage         |
| `release`       | TagPush   | Distribution, GitHub Release |
| `release_image` | TagPush   | PushDockerImage              |
| `website`       | Push, PR  | Update website               |


#### [`audit`](https://github.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/blob/main/.github/workflows/audit.yaml)  

It is scheduled to run periodically, updating the advisory database for `cargo audit` to the latest version before executing `cargo audit`

#### [`ci`](https://github.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml)

Continuous integration is executed, and test coverage is uploaded to Codecov.  
When Dependabot updates dependencies and it is a patch version, it automatically merges the changes.

#### [`release`](https://github.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)

The workflow generated by `cargo dist` crates binaries and a GitHub release when a tag is pushed.  
Whether a package is included in this workflow is controlled by the `[package.metadata.dist.dist]` section in the Cargo.toml file.

#### [`release_image`](https://github.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/blob/main/.github/workflows/releases_image.yml)

Build the package's docker image and push it to the registry

#### [`website`](https://github.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/blob/main/.github/workflows/website.yaml)

The workflow generated by `oranda generate ci` uploads the project's website to GitHub Pages.

#### `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`

* [cargo-dist doc](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/homebrew.html)
* `repo` scope is required

#### `NPM_TOKEN`

* [cargo-dist doc](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/npm.html)
* Packages and scopes: Read and write
  * Select packages: All packages (NOTE: because the package does not yet exist, you must pick this. However, you can (and probably should!) update this to scope the token to a single package after publish. This is sadly a limitation of the npm token system.)
  * Organizations: No access
